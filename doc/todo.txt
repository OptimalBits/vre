True Type rendering TODO LIST:

x Add support for polygon contours in the clipping function.
x Add clipping to the vre_text primitive.
- Add bounding box generation for the vre_text primitive.
~ Analyze memory consumption.

- Perform refactoring and integrate truetype within vre framework
  (adding clipping, transforming support, and tile based rendering).

x Implement bezier flattening for curves.
x Add a transformation matrix to glyph_to_poly function. (font scaling,
  ( shear (cursive), and rotations).
x Fix for contours that do not have start and end on curve points.

x Implement composite glyphs.
- implement when ARGS_ARE_XY_VALUES is not set (they are points).

x Implement antialiasing in rendering function.

~ Implement font metrics.
~ Implement kerning.

x Implement cmaps.
x implement cmap format 0
x implement cmap format 4 (unicode)
- implement cmap format 6 (unicode)
- implement cmap format 12 (newest unicode)

- implement CRC checksum for .ttf files.

x Improve point accuracy to 16.16 bits.
x Improve visual quality of the polygon renderer.
x Implement antialiasing in polygon renderer.
- Optimize polygon renderer.

x Implement destructors and check for easy-fixed memory leaks.

x Implement a drawText function.

x Implement a font wrapper module for fonts.

x Implement a cache mechanism for glyphs.

- Write extensive tests for the true type functionality.
- Implement tests with a lot of different TTF formats.

- Document code using doxygen semantics.



- remove all 64 bits multiplications and data types.
- optimize mem copy and mem set functions.

BUGS:

- fixed. exclamation symbol appears twice in positions 2 and 3.
